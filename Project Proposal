Project Proposal
I want to create a project use for my video game, tracking what video game I played, the name of the video game, what system what the game on, how much does it cost when I first bought it, and the price it change over time, a rating for the game, and a comment field that I can put comments. The project should take about 8 days to be finish.
Day1: create a prototype of MVC for the web page. /index page and everything.
Day2: validate the data before import into database. Create service to connect to database.
Day3: create database to hold the data.
Day4: create controller for all different view page.
Day5: create logs to keep the errors.
Day6: design outlook of the project, finish up the project
Day7: test everything on the website and make sure there is no error.
Day8: Comment the code. And submitting the project.
If you have any idea what other fields I should add, Iâ€™d be happy to add it in the project.
